You can even [inset a link to Google](http://google.com)\n\n## Lists\n\nSometimes you want numbered lists:\n\n1. One\n2. Two\n3. Three\n\nSometimes you want bullet points:\n\n* Start a line with a star\n* Profit!\n\nAlternatively,\n\n- Dashes work just as well\n- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:\n  - Like this\n  - And this\n\n## Images\n\nIf you want a link to a local image, place the image in the `img` folder and then insert a link like this:\n\n![](img/02.jpg)\n\nAlternatively you can directly link to images on the web:\n\n![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)\n\nThe above includes a title.\n\n# Structured documents\n\nSometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.\n\n### This is a third-tier heading\n\nYou can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.\n\nIf you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:\n\n> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.\n> - Captain Janeway\n\nThere are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:\n\n    if (isAwesome){\n      return true\n    }\n\nGitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:\n\n~~~\nif (isAwesome){\n  return true\n}\n~~~\n\nAnd if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:\n\n~~~javascript\nif (isAwesome){\n  return true\n}\n~~~\n\n",
